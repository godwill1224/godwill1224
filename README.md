## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Mawa Godwill

A passionate and self-taught **Full Stack Developer** with 3+ years of hands-on experience in developing scalable websites, web and mobile applications. Proficient in developing databases, creating user interfaces, writing and testing codes, troubleshooting simple/complex issues, and implementing new features based on user feedback.

From the moment I produced "Hello World!" in the console of my first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of software development. But software development has never been "just a job" for me, it has offered an engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high-quality software. What started with a simple "Hello World!" has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as
the years go by.
